You can call it Sam (sam) for simplicity. Why \u00b6 At the beginning of our adapting to SOA , we used HAProxy as a client-side load balancer. It does the job, painfully, as we have to do a file-based re-configuration whenever a change happens to the back-end nodes. The maintenance of the configuration file really hurts our OPs a lot, not to mention that a reload to HAProxy causes downtime. This issue is so popular that people created things like Synapse and Bamboo to manage HAProxy instances, even hack deeply to minimize the downtime caused by HAProxy reload . Those are great projects and actually get things done, however our approach to this is different, we want something more solid than templated configuration file with managed HAProxy processes. Boldly we decide to write our own load balancer with SOA in mind to replace HAProxy, and that is Samaritan . We name this project Samaritan for saving our OPs from extreme misery: A charitable or helpful person (with reference to Luke 10:33). \"suddenly, miraculously, a Good Samaritan leaned over and handed the cashier a dollar bill on my behalf\" Design goals \u00b6 Simple, modular, testable High performance with as little resources as possible Support hot upgrade, and the impact is as small as possible Keep the external interface is lightweight and backward compatible Be as transparent as possible and reduce business transformation Features \u00b6 Sidecar Sam is a separated process which runs alongside the application. All the requests to basic components such as MySQL , Redis and MQ from application will be proxied by the local instance. It shields the cluster discovery, switching, shrinking and other details in the distributed environment of the basic components, so that the application can use as smooth as a single machine. Written by golang Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. It has good performance and is widely used in the cloud environment. Hot re-configuration without downtime Sam supports obtaining the proxy configuration and service endpoints from the remote and updating at runtime which means doesn't need to restart at all. It greatly reduces the cost of operation and maintenance, makes the large-scale deployment possible. First-class Redis cluster support Redis Cluster provides a way to run a Redis installation where data is automatically sharded across multiple Redis nodes. Sam supports L7 transparent proxy for redis requests, will forward the request to the correct node automatically. In addition, also supports transparent compression for big key and real-time hot key collection. Good observability Provide detailed metrics about connection and request which could help us understand the state of network and services, make decisions. These exported statistics could be viewable via prometheus or the local admin api. How it works \u00b6 Sam pulls proxy strategy and service endpoints from the management server and do the load balancing at client side. Sash is a management server. It delivers the change of proxy strategy and service endpoints to the related sam instances. Also, provides the ops tools, such as deploy, upgrade, etc. Sash is a combination of Sam and Dashboard. Next step \u00b6 I believe that by reading the above chapters, you should have a basic impression and concept of Sam, then you can try to play with it .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#what","text":"Samaritan (s\u0259\u02c8mer\u0259tn) is a client side proxy that works on L4 or L7 layer written by golang, provide high availability and load balancing.

Installation \u00b6 Pre-built binaries \u00b6 It's the fastest way, you can choose the appropriate binaries from release page . Assuming your os system is darwin and platform is amd64, you can use the following command to download and install. $ VERSION = 1 .0.0 OS = darwin ARCH = amd64 curl -fsSL \\ https://github.com/samaritan-proxy/samaritan/releases/download/v $VERSION /samaritan $VERSION . $OS - $ARCH .tar.gz \\ -o /tmp/samaritan- $VERSION .tar.gz && \\ tar -zxvf /tmp/samaritan- $VERSION .tar.gz && \\ install /tmp/samaritan- $VERSION /samaritan /usr/local/bin Note You should replace the version, os system and arch information in download link as needed. Manually build \u00b6 If the pre-built binaries doesn't meet your needs or want to try the lastest features which are not released, you could build it from the source code. This first needs Go installed(version 1.13+ is required). Warning The master branch is in continuous development and has not undergone the extensive testing and verification.

Configuration \u00b6 In the aboved section, we generate a simple configuration file and start Sam with it. But you may have no idea about it, you may be overwhelmed. For better understanding, we will show you the specific parts of the configuration file. instance \u00b6 The instance message is used to specify the environment in which the instance is located, and will be reported to the management server. instance : id : ip_port belong : sash Warning If you want to use the dynamic config feature, you must add this section to configuration file. log \u00b6 The log message is used to specify the log level and output destination. log : level : INFO output : type : SYSLOG target : 127.0.0.1:514 If it is omitted, the log level will be INFO and the message will be printed to terminal. Why does the output not support files If the disk io hang, the whole process will probably hang when not handled correctly, we don't want this to happen. There are a lot mature toolkit to process logs in linux system, such as ryslog and logrotate. We should reuse them instead of creating ourselves. stats \u00b6 The stats message is used to specify the stats config include internal metrics config and sinks. stats : sinks : - type : STATSD endpoint : example.com:8125 If it is omitted, the internal metrics wouldn't flush to any TSDB except Prometheus which could still be visited via /amin/stats/prometheus . Prometheus is sufficient for most users which means you could omit the stats config directly. admin \u00b6 The admin message is used to specify the configuration for local admin api. admin : bind : ip : 127.0.0.1 port : 12345 It's required, otherwise the entire process cannot be started. More details about admin api, you can view doc static services \u00b6 The static service message is used to specify the static service including name, proxy strategy and endpoints. static_services : - name : example.com config : listener : address : ip : 127.0.0.1 port : 8080 protocol : TCP endpoints : - address : ip : 93.184.216.34 port : 80 You can use it to configure the proxy's services in a local development environment, but it is not recommended. Here are the reasons: Contains a lot configuraton items, easy to make mistakes when writing by hand. Unable to support large-scale operation and maintenance, imagine how to update the configuration if deployed to a 10k machines. It's so horrible. The correct and recommended way is to use dynamic source, which will be described in detail below. dynamic source \u00b6 The dynamic source message is used to specify the dynamic source configuration. dynamic_source_config : endpoint : example.com:80 Once the dynamic source is configured, Sam could know and apply the changes of instance's dependent services, service's proxy policy and service's endpoints in real time. The communication way between them is grpc, and here is the specific interface definition. Tip As the management server, Sash will implement all the interface required by dynamic source. It is still private now, but we will open source as soon as possible. Examples \u00b6 We have created some sandboxes using Docker and Docker Compose to show how to use Samaritan. To run them, please make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed. TCP \u00b6 In this example, we show how to use Samaritan as a L4 proxy. Step 1: Start all containers including http-server and proxy $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/samaritan-proxy/samaritan.git /tmp/samaritan $ cd /tmp/samaritan/examples/tcp $ docker-compose up Step 2: View http://127.0.0.1 using curl or browser $ curl http://127.0.0.1 You could see the response: hello, world!

Most redis client implementations don't support redis cluster.

We used twemproxy before, but it relies on sentinel for high availabity, it also requires restarting to add or remove backend redis instances, which causes service interruption. And twemproxy is single threaded, we have to deploy multiple twemproxy instances for large number of clients, which causes the ops headaches.
